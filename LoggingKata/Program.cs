            // Create a new Coordinate with your locB's lat and long
            // Now, compare the two using `GeoCalculator.GetDistance(origin, destination)`, which returns a double
            // If the distance is greater than the currently saved distance, update the distance and the two `ITrackable` variables you set above

            // Once you've looped through everything, you've found the two Taco Bells furthest away from each other.
